# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I have to install `ipykernel` manually?

Virtual environments should be reproducible. We will not modify the project environment in any way.


## How can I change the directory for the virtual environment?

Currently, the virtual environment has to be in a `.venv` folder. In future versions, we will allow to change this via an environment variable.


## How does this kernel differ from poetry-kernel?

TBD
